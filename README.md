The original project did not build correctly for some reasons after I downloaded it. Thus I couldn't see the instructions.
I opened the solution project file and saw class libraries project there. Therefore I created them in a new project, added interfaces and its implementing class there.
The project is still incomplete as I didn't have enough time to complete it.
There might be memory related discrepanicies in the project.
